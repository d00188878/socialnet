Explain how to run your tests

To run our tests/queries we used user inputs, depending on the user's
choice input we sent the responses to run the queries

Depending on the user's choice the user types the required information
and that information it is then sent to the selected method from the 
data getter functions (DFG) class.

The file where the class is in uses sqlite3 and os.path
each one of the methods within the class run a querie using the users's input.
